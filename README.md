## The Problem

It is hard to find in-stock boutique mechanical keyboards in Europe, because there are few stores and **very** limited stock.

This leaves users having to browse through several websites just to gather their options.

## The solution

This website congregates data about in-stock keyboard, mechanical switches, cases, and keycaps across EU websites.

## Currently supports:

- [My Keyboard EU](https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/)
- [KeyGem](https://keygem.store/)

## Looking to support:

- [Candy Keys](https://candykeys.com/)
    : Stocks keyboards, switches, cases and keycaps.
- [Falba Tech](https://falba.tech/)
    : Stocks custom, wooden, split/ergonomic keyboards.
- [Oblotzky Industries](https://oblotzky.industries/)
    : Stocks keyboards, swithces, cases, PCBs and keycaps.
- [Split KB](https://splitkb.com/)
    : Stocks DIY keyboard kits, cases, PCBs, switches and keycaps.
